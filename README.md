# Machine-Learning-
The project works on cancer dataset and uses Machine learning algorithms to classify people with cancer. The project builds a custom KNN function and finds accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score for the custom KNN model. Then the model use PCA reduction to reduce number of features and still get the same results.
